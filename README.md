# ENME489x-Energy-Conversion-Systems-for-Sustainability

Project 1 - This project deals with the study of the potential for end-use energy efficiency and renewable energy in New York City to better understand future options for New Yorkâ€™s energy supply. The primary objective of this report is to create a baseline scenario for meeting all the energy needs(electrical, heat, cooling and transportation) detailing the associated costs, efficiencies and energy capacities using non renewable sources of energy.  

Project 2 - The first part of this project deals with the ideas that can be incorporated in a household to reduce energy usage and increase the energy savings as efficient energy use is one of the most important aspects of energy sustainability. The second part of the project deals with identifying the impact of adding an electric vehicle to the findings in Part A. The objective is to analyse whether the saved electricity can be used to charge an electric car leading to energy and gas savings and how it will impact the cost/benefit of the ideas suggested in Part A.
